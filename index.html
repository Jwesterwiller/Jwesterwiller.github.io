            The great thing about a degree in information Science is that its so well rounded
            that it allows for multiple career avenues to go down.
            However, I see most of mine leading to a DevOps or a Project Manager position.
             Ultimaley, This is my long term goal, needing a few short term goals to come to
              fruition. My first goal in achieving this is to continue my education by pursue a
              master’s degree in information systems or information management.
              My next goal is to further develop my technical skills while advancing my knowledge of industry.
               Lastly, I will pursue certification such as PMP, and Agile and Scrum Master.
                After reaching these goals I would like to pursue opportunities that improve the quality
                of life for those less fortunate through technology.
